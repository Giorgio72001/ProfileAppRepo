A repository for my profile app CSC 305

App will include the ability to save user information locally and be connected to a backend database. User will be able to log in with an email and password they created and choose to save these details. 
User may also put in more personal information to be saved like name, image, birthday, height, and weight. User may then sign out or reset password to their desire.
